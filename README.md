# Smart-ATS-using-Streamlit

This project uses Python's Streamlit library to create a resume ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scanner powered by Gemini Pro AI. The application allows users to upload a resume, which is then analyzed against a job description using AI to evaluate the match, identify missing keywords, and provide feedback for improvement. The tool offers a user-friendly interface to enhance resumes and optimize their alignment with job requirements.
